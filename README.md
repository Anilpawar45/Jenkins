Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, automating tasks like building, testing, and deploying software, and is a popular DevOps tool. 
## What it is:
Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server written in Java that facilitates the automation of tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software. 
## CI/CD:
Jenkins is primarily used to implement CI/CD workflows, which automate the process of integrating code changes, building, testing, and deploying software. 
## How it works:
Jenkins automates these processes by executing jobs triggered by events like new commits, branches, or pull requests.
